# Summary: Setting up a Simple Landing Page for Policy Impact

We created a simple, static landing page for policyimpact.us with these components:

1. **Files Created:**
   - HTML landing page (index.html)
   - CSS styling (styles.css)
   - SVG favicon (favicon.svg)

2. **Page Structure:**
   - Header with navigation
   - Hero section with platform introduction
   - Features section highlighting key platform capabilities
   - How It Works section explaining the workflow
   - Contact section
   - Footer with links and copyright

3. **Deployment Method:**
   - AWS S3 bucket configured for static website hosting
   - Bucket named policyimpact.us
   - Setup through AWS Console (General purpose bucket)
   - Files manually uploaded with proper content types
   - Bucket policy set to allow public read access

4. **Expected Result:**
   - Landing page accessible via http://policyimpact.us.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
   - Domain setup will eventually point policyimpact.us to this content
   - Next steps would include setting up CloudFront for HTTPS support

5. **Email Configuration:**
   - We verified that email is configured with Microsoft 365 (MX records point to policyimpact-us.mail.protection.outlook.com)
   - Email addresses like info@policyimpact.us will be delivered to your Microsoft 365 tenant

This landing page will serve as a placeholder while the full React/TypeScript platform with AWS backend is being developed.
